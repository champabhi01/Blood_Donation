  <h1 id="text5">why should donate blood</h1>
  <p id="tex6"> Lifesaving Impact: A single blood donation can help up to three people in need. Blood is used in surgeries, transfusions for accidents or illnesses, and for patients with chronic conditions. There's a constant demand, and donations ensure a steady supply.
    Health Benefits for You: Donating blood can stimulate your body to produce new red blood cells, potentially reducing iron overload in some cases. This can lower the risk of certain health problems.
    Feel-Good Factor: Helping others is a rewarding experience. Donating blood allows you to contribute to the well-being of your community and creates a positive sense of well-being for yourself.
    Quick and Easy: The actual donation process typically takes less than an hour, with most of the time spent on screening and registration.</p>
